## Intro

I am a DPhil (PhD) student at [Oxford University](http://www.ox.ac.uk) specialising in computational genomics in neurological disease, supervised by [Caleb Webber](http://www.dpag.ox.ac.uk/team/group-leaders/caleb-webber) and [Chris Ponting](http://www.dpag.ox.ac.uk/team/group-leaders/chris-ponting). My research focusses on analytical methods for single-cell genomics and I'm particularly interested in using bayesian statistics on noisy, high-dimensional datasets.

## Short bio

I was an undergraduate in mathematical physics at Edinburgh and then studied for a master's degree in computational biology at Cambridge. I have been a summer intern far too many times - at the [EBI](http://www.ebi.ac.uk), [CERN](http://www.cern.ch), [ILL](http://www.ill.fr) and twice at Agilent Technologies (now [Keysight](http://www.keysight.com)).
